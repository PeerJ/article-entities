        <h2>An example section</h2>
        <p>All 10 large herbivore species within the families Elephantidae, Hippopotamidae, Hominidae, and Tapiridae are currently threatened. The large herbivores of the families Suidae, Rhinocerotidae, Equidae, and Camelidae are also highly endangered, with 15 of 20 member species threatened. Only eight terrestrial megafauna species (â‰¥1000 kg) exist today as opposed to more than five times that number (~42) that were present in the late Pleistocene. The eight remaining species are split between Africa (African elephant, <i>Loxodonta africana</i>, hippopotamus, <a href="http://example.com/"><i>Hippopotamus amphibius</i></a>, and the white and black rhinoceros, <i>Ceratotherium simum</i> and <em>Diceros bicornis</em>, respectively) and Southeast Asia (Asian elephant, <i>Elephas maximus</i>, and the Indian, Javan, and Sumatran rhinoceros, <i>Rhinoceros unicornis</i>, <i>R. sondaicus</i>, and <i>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</i>, respectively). Of these, seven are threatened, including four critically endangered, and the white rhinoceros is nearly threatened with the current poaching crisis likely to alter its status downward in the near future. Ironically, this endangerment follows one of the greatest success stories in the history of modern conservation: the recovery of the southern white rhino (<i>C. simum simum</i>) from a single population of fewer than 100 individuals in the early 1900s to about 20,000 today. Even with the current crisis of rhinoceros poaching, this illustrates that, with sufficient protection, recovery is possible for relatively slow-breeding species that are highly prized by poachers.</p>

        <p>The distribution of most recently discovered or described lemur species remains poorly known, but many appear to have small geographical ranges, making them vulnerable to extinction. Research can contribute to future conservation actions on behalf of these species by providing accurate information on local distribution and abundance. The distribution of the world's smallest primate, the endangered Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (<em>Microcebus berthae</em>), is limited to the Menabe Central region of western Madagascar. This species was discovered in the 1990s, but many fundamental aspects of its ecology remain unknown. The aims of our study were therefore to determine the actual distribution of Microcebus berthae across the forests of this region, to estimate population density, and to examine the species' response to anthropogenic activities. We established 35 1-km line transects across Menabe Central, on which we surveyed mouse lemurs by distance sampling and live trapping. <em>Microcebus berthae</em> does not occur in all remaining forests of this small region and its population density is highly heterogeneous, both across its geographic range and locally. Within its area of occupancy, the population of <em>Microcebus berthae</em> not only was distributed according to spatial heterogeneities of the habitat, but also responded to anthropogenic disturbances and varied seasonally. Our results indicate that Microcebus berthae is susceptible to habitat degradation and avoids human environments spatially. As none of the forest remnants in which the species still occurs were officially protected until recently, immediate conservation actions should focus on effectively protecting Kirindy and Ambadira forests.</p>
